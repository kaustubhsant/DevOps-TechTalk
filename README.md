1.Active deploy. -> Nikhil

2.**Auto Scaling**:
  
With AutoScaling feature, IBM Bluemix allows us to manage the compute capacity of our application. Whenever the load on our application increases,more instances are spawned and traffic will be directed to new instances as well. In this feature, we have the option to specify parameters like 
  * 'Scale-out' : The number of new instances to be spawned in case load increases.
  * 'Scale-in' : The number of instances to be removed when we need to scale down.
  * 'Allowable Maximum Instance Count': The maximum number of instances can be started. Scaling does not happen beyond this limit.
